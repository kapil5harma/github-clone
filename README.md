### Github Clone using Github API v4

#### Steps to run the app on your local system:

- Download/clone [this](https://github.com/kapil5harma/github-clone) repository
- Open the project in terminal
- Run `npm install` or `npm i`
- Run `npm run start` or `npm start`

#### Note:

1. Used React (using boilerplate from create-react-app).
2. Used Apollo Client for using data queried from / mutated using Github's v4 API based on GraphQL.
3. Source code listing is not et siupported in Github API v4, so fetch API is used in the project to query source files from Github API v3.
4. As of now, due to time constraints, the app can show data on my personal github account.
5. Due to same reason, the repo detail page shows details of Portfolio repository on my account.
6. On mutation part, you can Star/Unstar and Watch/Unwatch the repository.
